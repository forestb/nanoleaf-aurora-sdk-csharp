# Introduction
For getting started with the Nanoleaf API, see [The Nanoleaf API](https://nanoleaf.me/en/consumer-led-lighting/products/smarter-series/nanoleaf-cloud/nanoleaf-local-api/) official page for more.

Once logged in to [the Nanoleaf developer portal](https://forum.nanoleaf.me/forum), navigate to [the Nanoleaf developer docs](https://forum.nanoleaf.me/docs).

There are two means of integrating: [the Light Panels SDK](https://forum.nanoleaf.me/docs/) and [the Light Panels Open API](https://forum.nanoleaf.me/docs/openapi).

This library is a wrapper around the [Light Panels Open API](https://forum.nanoleaf.me/docs/openapi).
